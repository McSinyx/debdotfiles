# Gruvbox awesome theme by McSinyx

## A few side notes

* The backgrounds are pixel-based, so please resize them by proper algorithim,
  e.g. in GIMP use *None* or *Linear* interpolation.

* Titlebar and wibox use some pixel art, so please keep theme at the size of 24
  (wibox) and 6 (titlebar).

* I add some 24-pixel high arrow to the theme. You might wanna use it to rice
  your desktop in the powerarrow way
