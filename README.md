# debdotfiles
Dotfiles of my Debian testing system, managed by GNU Stow.

This repository contains my configurations for awesome, bash, Git, GTK+,
ranger, Vim, Vimperator (a Firefox add-on) and xterm. Most of those
applications are themed with the [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)
colorscheme's light version.
