# dotfiles

Dotfiles of my Debian testing and Fedora systems, managed by GNU Stow.

The Debian desktop uses awesome, bash, Git, Luakit, ranger, Vim, XTerm
and Zathura. Most of these applications are themed with the
[gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) colorscheme's light version.

The newly-set-up Fedora is simply GNOME and Emacs.
