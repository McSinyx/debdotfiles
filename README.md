# dotfiles

Dotfiles of my Debian testing, Fedora workstation and NixOS unstable,
managed by GNU Stow.

![Debian testing](debian-screenshot.png)

The Debian desktop uses awesome, bash, Git, Firefox, ranger, Vim, URxvt
and Zathura. Most of these applications are themed with the
[srcery](https://github.com/srcery-colors/srcery-vim) colorscheme.

![Fedora workstation](fedora-screenshot.png)

The Fedora desktop is vanilla GNOME with Emacs. Yes you can run four systems
in parallel: GNU/Linux, systemd, GNOME JS VM and Emacs.

![NixOS unstable](nixos-screenshot.png)

The NixOS uses KDE Plasma with Emacs and Alacritty.  Nothing really special
other than the Nix itself.
